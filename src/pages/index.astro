        – Abstract
      </h2>
      <p>
        I am inspired by how the science and application of software can
        <b>positively</b> impact people across the world.
      </p>

      <p>To me, the best parts of making software are</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <b>continuously learning</b> fascinating concepts and technologies freely
          shared by those before me, and
        </li>
        <li>
          leveraging these with good taste & design to make products that
          <b>delight users</b>.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p class="mb-0">
        With other engineers and on my own, I’ve built complex, resilient
        products for meeting diverse needs with modern web technologies.

        – Early Career
      </h2>
      <p>
        My journey as a developer began in a humble place—a high school math
        class, when I discovered that graphing calculators can be programmed.
        What started as writing small scripts to solve small problems quickly
        evolved. In a nod to retro arcade games, I ended the class having
        written a full-fledged Galaga clone on my calculator—with animation,
        progressive difficulty, and a scoring system.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-0">
        After earning my degree in 2019, and discovering that the web is much
        more suitable for delighting people with software, I have been seeking
        out as much knowledge as I can so that I can excel in my role. I’ve
        developed a deep understanding of React, TypeScript, Node.js, and other
        technologies, and I enjoy applying them to help others.
      </p>

        <span aria-hidden>III</span>
        – Current Work
      </h2>
      <p>
        I’m happily employed, working remotely with a small team on
        <a href="https://learnplatform.com">LearnPlatform</a> by <span
          class="whitespace-nowrap"
        >
          <a href="https://www.instructure.com">Instructure</a>.
        </span> I’ve had the opportunity to dive into technologies I had little prior
        experience in, such as Ruby on Rails and Chrome extension development, and
        quickly became productive with the support of more senior engineers. It’s
        an honor to serve our education system.
      </p>
      <p>
        After making the case for using TypeScript to my team, I’m proud to be
        leading our gradual migration from plain JavaScript to TypeScript and to
        act as a local TypeScript expert. In the process, I have been reminded
        of how much one must learn about a subject in order to teach it, and
        challenged to continue growing. A codebase migration like this is as
        much of a social process as it is a technical one, so I am also focused
        on ensuring that others feel empowered by the change, not daunted.
      </p>
      <p>
        Outside of my employment, I have had the privilege to join the Solid
        Ecosystem Team in recognition of my work on <span
          class="whitespace-nowrap"
        >
          <a href="https://github.com/solidjs-community/eslint-plugin-solid">
            eslint-plugin-solid</a
          >,
        </span> an open source package that helps both new and experienced <a
          href="https://www.solidjs.com">Solid</a
        >
        developers write better code. Though I enjoy working with React, I believe
        Solid presents a compelling alternative focused on performance and developer
        experience.

        <!--(As explained in my full post,)--> Creating this project has been one
        of the most challenging and rewarding experiences of my career. It’s demonstrated
        the value of the science of compilers in production-grade tooling. Seeing
        over 100 GitHub stars and over 1,000 GitHub repositories using my project
        has validated that identifying a problem and presenting a solution to the
        world can make a real impact. I’m grateful for the <!--(N - pull from GitHub)-->
        contributors that have helped make the project better.
